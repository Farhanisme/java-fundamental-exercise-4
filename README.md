# Java Fundamental Exercise 4

This repository contains a collection of lab exercises focusing on fundamental data structures and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java. Each directory represents a distinct topic, exploring core programming principles through various assignments and projects.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each containing programs related to a specific topic:

* **`p1-array`**: Programs demonstrating basic and advanced operations on arrays. This includes calculations with salaries, integrals, and student grades. Files often include a `Modifikasi` (Modified) version, which likely adds enhanced functionality or provides a different approach to the problem.
* **`p2-arraymultidimensi`**: Exercises dedicated to multidimensional arrays. Projects here include tasks like calculating distances between points, managing student grades, and generating a Pascal's triangle.
* **`p3-function`**: Programs that explore the use of functions to break down code into reusable modules. Files with `mod` in their names may present alternative function implementations or variations of the original problem.
* **`p4-classobject`**: A deep dive into object-oriented programming concepts. This directory contains multiple files that likely demonstrate class creation, object instantiation, and method calls, with examples related to TV operations and geometric shapes.
* **`p5-stack`**: Implementations and exercises using the Stack data structure. This directory showcases how a stack works and its practical applications.
* **`p6-linkedlist`**: Projects dedicated to the Linked List data structure. Programs here demonstrate how to create, traverse, and manipulate nodes in a linked list.
  
## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the `.java` files, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Compile the Java file** using the `javac` command. Replace `YourFileName.java` with the actual file name.
    ```
    javac YourFileName.java
    ```

2.  **Run the compiled program** using the `java` command. Do not include the `.class` file extension.
    ```
    java YourFileName
    ```
    If your program relies on other classes, make sure to compile all related `.java` files in that directory.
